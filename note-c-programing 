60 Chapter 2 Intro to C Programming
Self Check
1 (Multiple Choice) Consider the code:
int main(void)
Which of the following statements is false?
a) The parentheses after main indicate that it is a function.
b) The keyword int to the left of main indicates that main returns an integer value, and the void in parentheses means that main does not receive any information.
c) A left parenthesis, (, begins every function’s body. A corresponding right parenthesis, ), ends each function’s body.
d) When execution reaches the end of main, the program terminates.
Answer: c) is false. Actually, a left brace, {, begins every function’s body, and a corresponding right brace, }, ends each function’s body.
2 (Multiple Choice) Which of the following statements is false?
a) Each printf resumes printing where the previous one stopped printing.
b) In the following code, the first printf displays Welcome followed by a space,
and the second printf begins printing on the next line of output:
 printf("Welcome ");
 printf("to C!\n");
c) The following printf prints several lines of text:
 printf("Welcome\nto\nC!\n");
d) Each time a \n escape sequence is encountered, output continues at the beginning of the next line.
Answer: b) is false. Actually, the second printf begins printing immediately following the space output by the first printf.
2.3 Another Simple C Program: Adding Two Integers
Our next program uses the scanf standard library function to obtain two integers
typed by a user at the keyboard, then computes their sum and displays the result using
printf. The program and sample output are shown in Fig. 2.4. In the input/output
dialog box of Fig. 2.4, we emphasize the numbers entered by
